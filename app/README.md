========

Source: https://www.sitepoint.com/starting-android-development-creating-todo-app/
Activity Time: 60 min

This app creates a simple todo list!. It:

- Allows user to add an item to a list
- Allows user to delete item from the list

All Java code is complete and it does not require any modification to work. Instead, this activity
gives students a sandbox to change the colors and inputs. 

### Setup:
- Open in Android Studio
- Open the "todo" project
- Open the following files: item_todo.xml, colors.xml, strings.xml

Students should follow along with the instructor.


## Instructors:

There are 2 branches in this repository. Master branch has the completed code. Student branch 
is a sandbox for students to complete the following tasks:

1. Fix the layout by aligning the text box and buttons as needed (item_todo.xml)
2. Update the colors (colors.xml)
3. Update the field names (strings.xml)

Students can customize as much as they want. No Java is required for this project. 

At the end of the workshop, students can download their app to their Android phones. Students who
don't have phones should preview the app with someone nearest them who has one, just so they can see
a live demonstration. 

To create an .apk:
1. Go to: Build > Build APK
2. Connect phone to laptop; click "Yes" to opening as storage device.
3. Open the "Phone" directory in the next window and navigate to the "Downloads" folder.
4. Drag and drop the .apk into the "Downloads" folder.
5. On the phone, navigate to the file manager "My Files"
6. Navigate to the "Downloads" folder and double tap the relevant apk (app_debug.apk by default)
7. You'll be prompted to allow the phone to run the app. Toggle the appropriate setting.

The app should open once that's done and students can play with it. 

If there are no cables to attach phone to the laptop you can do the following:
- Upload the .apk to Google Drive, Github or Bitbucket.
- Have students visit the link to the download from their phones.
- Download and open the file as instructed above.
